# Chemical Geology
This repository keeps my final project for my chemical geology course, which I took in Spring 2022. This project is a python-based solver for equilibrium pressure and H2O-CO2 solubilities, based off the equations from Iacono-Marziano et al., (2012).

My project report is the Word document, George_Lu_report.docx, and the script itself is h2o_co2_calc.py. To access these, you can simply download the entire folder or pull it using git.
